    Our mission is to provide financial assistance to underpriveleged women who cannot afford expensive breast care treatment, medicine, and/or therapy. 
        </br>
    The Shirts For a Cure Project (SFAC) was launched by Syrentha J. Savio Endowment (SSE) to raise awareness about breast cancer prevention. 
        </br>
    When a band donates a shirt design to SFAC, the design becomes exlusive to SSE, with all proceeds going towards helping women fight their battle with breast cancer.
